# Car Wash Booking System

This project consists of two Python programs that manage a car wash booking system. 

## Files

- `car_wash_customer_program.py`: This program is used by customers to book a car wash. It collects contact and booking information, and confirms the booking.

- `car_wash_employee_program.py`: This program is used by employees to manage bookings. It provides options to list and remove bookings, calculate the number of employees needed, and quit the program.

- `booking_info.csv`: This file stores the booking information.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the customer program to make a booking: `python car_wash_customer_program.py`
3. Run the employee program to manage bookings: `python car_wash_employee_program.py`
